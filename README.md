### Purpose <a name="item1"></a>
I built this page to practice web design with strong limitations and guidelines. When creating something from scratch, it is easy to take creative shortcuts to achieve a goal, but through the process of creating a 1-1 copy of a preexisting page, I was forced to learn and execute concepts that I was not previously super familiar with. 

### Built with <a name="builtWith"></a>
- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS
- JavaScript 
- Bootstrap 

### Getting Started <a name="gettingStarted"></a>
This is a remotely hosted page, and can be accessed at https://matt0792.github.io/moog-clone/
